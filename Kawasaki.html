										<h2>History</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In 1985 Kawasaki launched, worldwide, the Vulcan VN700A, its first cruiser powered by its first V-twin engine. The VN700A has a shaft drive. Kawasaki also made the now rare VZ 750 variant with chromed wheel arches and other subtle differences. To avoid United States tariffs on Japanese motorcycles over 700cc, the initial US model was limited to 699 cc but in 1986, the tariff was lifted so the engine capacity was increased to 749 cc. Apart from paint schemes the Vulcan remained largely unchanged throughout its 22-year production run with only minor adjustments to components.</p>

											<p>Kawasaki introduced the Vulcan 400 in 1986 as an entry level cruiser. For a first series, the Vulcan 400 featured a 398 cc liquid-cooled twin engine, and was fitted with a belt drive and six-speed transmission. The series 2 Vulcan 400 featured a 399 cc liquid-cooled V-twin engine similar in design to the 750. The series 2 was fitted with a chain drive and five-speed transmission to reduce cost and was produced in both Classic and Drifter variations.</p>

											<p>The Vulcan 500 (EN500A) introduced in 1990 was the successor to the Kawasaki 454 LTD. The EN500A was fitted with a parallel twin 498 cc engine nearly identical to the Kawasaki Ninja 500R. It had a 6 speed transmission and belt final drive. The EN500A was discontinued after 1996 and replaced with the Vulcan 500 LTD (EN500C). Both versions were available as 1996 models. With the EN500C the ergonomics changed as well as the engine tuning. New cam shaft profiles and slightly lower compression pistons moved the power band down to increase low end torque. Also the carburetors were downsized from 34mm to 32mm. The belt final drive was replaced with a chain. The Vulcan 500 LTD was discontinued after the 2009 model year for a nearly 20 year production run.</p>

											<p>The Vulcan 650 S (EN650AF/BF) is designated as a Sport cruiser. Introduced in 2015 with an Ergo-Fit system designed for better custom comfort adjustability for different rider sizes. A choice of three foot peg positions, three seats and two handlebars are available to choose from, at time of purchase. The engine is a 649cc parallel twin derived from the Ninja 650. Retuned, heavier flywheel and redesigned intake give the Vulcan S more low and mid range torque. It has very non traditional cruiser looks with a unique frame and suspension layout.</p>

									<p>The Vulcan 1500 Classic has a 1,470 cc (90 cu in) liquid-cooled SOHC 50° V-twin engine with a single-pin crankshaft. It has a 27.6-inch (700 mm) seat height, wide handlebar, forward-mounted floorboards.
										The Vulcan 1500 Drifter ceased production in 2005. The Vulcan 88, with its 1464  cc liquid-cooled V-twin design was produced from 1987 through 1999. A four-speed transmission was blended with the "large for its time motor" and offered consumers a big-bore metric cruiser that was comfortable and relatively light-weight at just over 600 lbs when "rider ready".</p>
